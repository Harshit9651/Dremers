            <h2>my experience</h2>
         
       <p>My full name is Harshit Sharma and I belong to the Brahmin category. Our foundation's name is Vipra Foundation, where we provide assistance to children who aspire to study but lack financial resources. However, the story behind this is quite different. I applied in November 2021, but received no response for several days. Then someone told me that our MLA is associated with this foundation. So, I started visiting his office almost every day, but he was never available. Many times I went in the morning and returned at night, but couldn't meet the MLA. Then one day, I finally got to meet him and respectfully requested his help. He even spoke to the main head of the foundation, but still, there was no response. Then, my father happened to pick someone up from Delhi airport in a taxi, and that's how the conversation started. It turned out that the person's brother was the head of the foundation. So, he called me and after about 5-6 months, the funds finally came through. This process was lengthy, but the main thing is to never lose hope.</p>

                <h2>What is Foundation</h2>
                <p>
                    A foundation is a community organization that gathers funds from members of a particular social group and allocates those funds towards the development of that community. It plays a vital role in various aspects of community enhancement, including supporting the education of underprivileged children who have ambitious aspirations but lack financial resources. In essence, a foundation serves as a conduit for collective contributions towards the advancement and welfare of the community, with a focus on empowering individuals to pursue their dreams despite economic constraints.</p>
            </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of foundation</h2>
            <p>
                In every caste's foundation, financial assistance is provided to children's education in two ways. Firstly, the entire expense of a child's education is covered, and once the child secures a good job after completing their education, they are expected to repay the funds. Secondly, assistance is provided for the child's education without the expectation of repayment.
     </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How to apply and Register</h2>
            <p>You can apply to any caste's foundation in both offline and online forms, but it is most foolish of us to treat this as a form. This should not be done at all. I am going to tell you the very dirty reality of this. Some big people convert their black money into white money with the help of these foundations. If I tell you my experience, I went to people's homes and offices for a year asking them to help me. But people like to give money so that they can show off that I have helped them. so what should you do</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Listen carefully....</h2>
            <p>First of all, no matter where you live, look for those people who have better knowledge of your community or who are in a higher position. And if possible, go to the minister of your area and request him for help. And one more thing I would like to say is that if you are thinking that this work can be done in one or two or three days, then you are wrong. This process can take from one to one month, that too when you meet people every day. go and approach them</p>
